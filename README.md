# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-ML-with-Python

Introduction
In this Loan Status Prediction dataset, we have the data of applicants those who previously applied for the loan based on the property which is Property Loan.
The bank will decide whether to give a loan for the applicant based on some factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, previous Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etc..,
Our goal is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict the loan to be approved or to be rejected for an applicant.
In this project, we are going to classify an individual whether he/she can get the loan amount based on his/her Income, Education, Working Experience, Loan which is taken previously, and many more factors.
Letâ€™s get more into it by looking at the data.
